Telecom Churn Project
Problem Statement : To analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

 The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months.

 Introduction : Customers usually do not decide to switch to another competitor instantly, but rather over a period of time (this is especially applicable to high-value customers). In churn prediction, we assume that there are three phases of the customer lifecycle :

(1) The ‘good’ phase: In this phase, the customer is happy with the service and behaves as usual.

(2) The ‘action’ phase: The customer experience starts to become sore in this phase. For example, he/she gets a compelling offer from a competitor, is charged unfairly, becomes unhappy with service quality etc. In this phase, the customer usually shows different behaviour than in the ‘good’ months. Also, it is crucial to identify high-churn-risk customers in this phase, since some corrective actions can be taken at this point (such as matching the competitor’s offer/improving the service quality etc.)

(3) The ‘churn’ phase: In this phase, the customer is said to have churned. You define churn based on this phase.
